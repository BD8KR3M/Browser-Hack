# 🔒 Browser-Hack — Password Strength Checker or Stealthy Data Logger?

**Browser-Hack** is a deceptive yet educational Chrome extension that demonstrates how malicious browser add-ons can secretly exfiltrate user data. Although it looks like a friendly **password strength checker**, it silently logs sensitive information like keystrokes, cookies, browser history, and IP/User-Agent details.
